What does an Azure lock, lock?|The lock placed on a parent scope is inherited by all resources within that parent scope, this applies to existing and newly created resources in that parent scope. [Azure Locks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-lock-resources)
Who can remove an Azure lock?|To create or delete management locks, you must have access to Microsoft.Authorization/* or Microsoft.Authorization/locks/* actions. Of the built-in roles, only Owner and User Access Administrator are granted those actions.
What if I cannot remove the resource or the lock | Some Azure services, such as Azure Databricks, use managed applications to implement the service. In that case, the service creates two resource groups. One resource group contains an overview of the service and isn't locked. The other resource group contains the infrastructure for the service and is locked.<BR> - If you try to delete the infrastructure resource group, you get an error stating that the resource group is locked. If you try to delete the lock for the infrastructure resource group, you get an error stating that the lock can't be deleted because it's owned by a system application. <BR> - Instead, delete the service, which also deletes the infrastructure resource group.
Tag usage| Tags can be used for many purpose: Access Control and Compliance information, Automation tasks, Costing Information, Which resources are needed for generating reports. <BR>However do not have inconsistent tag data, example Department:HumanResources vs Department:HR this will create blindspots in your management and reporting. 
Page Blobs what are they good for| Page blobs are a collection of 512-byte pages, which provide the ability to read/write arbitrary ranges of bytes. Hence, page blobs are ideal for storing index-based and sparse data structures like OS and data disks for Virtual Machines and Databases [MS Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-pageblob-overview)

Is there any way to backup the metadata of non-vm resources from Azure so that we can restore resources to their original state|This is the wrong way to look at resources in cloud, we should be looking to use IaC (Infrastructure as Code), cloud should be modified by idempotent, not procedural, changes. In this way if a resource needs to be re-added we run the idempotent IaC to replay the creation of the resource.
